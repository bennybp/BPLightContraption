\section intro_sec Introduction & Rationale

The code is split into two parts. The microcontroller part contains code
that is compiled and uploaded to the microcontroller. This is written
in straight C.

The 'pc' folder contains the GUI, written in C++ and using Qt5.

See the <a href="../index.html">main page</a> for more information about
this project.

\section building_sec Building

For the microcontroller code, the compilation is straightforward. See
the compile.sh script for an example.

The GUI code is compiled using Qt (either qmake or using QtCreator). See
the <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtdoc/index.html">Qt5
documentation</a> for details.
